I am fascinated by the diversity of people, creative scenography and, of course, the uninhibited joy of dancing people. With my camera, I go beyond simple images; I strive to capture the essence of the event so that the viewer can feel the excitement and fun as if they were there themselves.<br><br>Analog photography adds an extra dimension to my work. The characteristic grain and subtle imperfections of film add to the nostalgic and artistic feel of my photographs. The limited number of shots per roll encourages me to choose each frame carefully, resulting in a collection of images that not only capture moments, but also tell a story. </p></div><div class="basis-1/2 mb-10"><img class="h-auto" src="'+t+'"></div></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 bg-gray-100"><img class="scale-75" src="'+o+'"><img class="scale-50 -translate-x-40" src="'+r+'"><img class="scale-75 translate-x-40 -translate-y-36" src="'+c+'"><img class="scale-50 -translate-y-80" src="'+i+'"><img class="scale-50 -translate-y-96" src="'+n+'"><img class="scale-75 -translate-y-80 -translate-x-40" src="'+l+'"></div>',2),m=[p],_={__name:"AnalogView",setup(g){return(h,d)=>(s(),a("main",null,m))}};export{_ as default};
